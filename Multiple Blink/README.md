MSP430F55229 - For this multiple blink method I implemented a simple method of having two LEDs blink at different speeds. I use BIT1.0 and BIT4.7 as the LEDs for this one which means I had to set them as outputs. I did that using the P1DIR and P4DIR to set them as outputs. I then created two counters called i1 and i2. Every clock cycle the counter will increment. For i1 once it reaches 25000 the if statement will execute and the P1.0 LED will be toggled on and off. The value i1 is also set back to 0 so that it can increment back up to the 25000 value and toggle the LED again. The i2 counter works in the same way except the value is 10000. When 10000 gets hit the PIN4.7 LED gets toggled then it gets reset to 0 so it will increment back to that value again. 


MSP430G2553 - For this multiple blink method is similar to the method for the other board besides the difference in the pins used for this board. The LEDs used for this board were P1.6 and P1.0, and I set them as outputs using P1DIR. I created two counters in this one two called i1 and i2. i1 and i2 were designed to increment until they hit a certain value to then execute to separate if statements. These if statements triggered the respective LEDs at two separate speeds than each other. After the LED is toggled the counter is set back to 0 so it can increment again.
