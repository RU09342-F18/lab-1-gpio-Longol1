MSP430G2253 - The button was located at P1.3, and the LED was located at P1.0. Using P1DIR I set P1.3 to 0 to make it an input and P1.0 to 1 to make it an output. Inside a while loop was an if else statement that was the functionality for the button press. For the G2553 the button sits high or at 1 when it is not pressed and low or 0 when it is pressed. The if statment condition was if((P1IN & BIT3) == 0), meaning if the button was off 1 would not equal 0, but if it was 1 then the if statement would execute. The if statment toggled the LED on and the else statment toggled the LED off.

MSP430F5529 - The button was located at P2.1. The LED was located at P4.7. Using P2DIR and P4DIR I set the LED to 1 making it an output and the button to 0 making it an input. In order to use the button I had to enable the pullup resistor at P2.1. The logic for this is the exact opposite from the other board. The button sits low or 0 when it isn't pushed. So the if statment was if((P2IN & BIT1) != 0), meaning when the button is pressed the statment will be 1 which does not equal 0 which makes the if statement execute. The if statment turns the LED on and when the button isnt pressed it turns the LED off.
