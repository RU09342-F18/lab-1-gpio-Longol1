The simple blink method I used for this board is very easy to understand. I used the Pin 1.6 LED on that board to make it blink. I OR Equaled P1DIR with BIT6 to make the LED an output. Then alls I did was have the LED toggle with a delay cycle speed of 25000 all within a infinite loop.

The simple blink method I used for this board was nearly the same as the first the only difference was the layout of pins on this board. For this one the LED is set to PIN4.7 which I used to toggle in an infinite loop at a delay cycle speed of 25000.
